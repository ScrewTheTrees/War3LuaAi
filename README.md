Early production of an AI framework using warcraft 3 framework and limitations.
Also has a little common.lua file for autocomplete of functions.

This project is written in IntelliJ Ultimate.
EmmyLua Plugin is highly reccomended for autocompletion and other similar functionality to make working here easier.

Only ceres config is necessary, no other configuration needed except the ceres commandline input (map name)
